# Nash Lite
Nash Prediction Exchange but with a lean margining system which supports only one order per side per contract per user.  

The faster order book system is used here, incorperating a linked list of prices to facilitate faster depth data lookup and filling of aggressing orders in o(n) time (where n is the number of levels queryed or interacted with by such order).
